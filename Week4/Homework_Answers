Question 1:
What is the count of records in the model fact_trips after running all 
models with the test run variable disabled and filtering for 2019 and 2020 data only (pickup datetime)?

Answer: 
Non of the Answers possible seemed to work for me maybe the wrong datasets were used.

Green_tripdata has 7.778.101 overall
Yellow_tripdata has 109.047.518 overall

Query:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(tripid)) FROM `striped-harbor-375816.taxi_dataset.fact_trips` 
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM pickup_datetime) IN (2019,2020)

My Result: 57102622 so the closest would be 61648442


Question 2:
